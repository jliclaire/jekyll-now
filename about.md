I am a student who is studying full stack web development with love and passion! Currently based in Melbourne, Australia. I joined the coding bootcamp with Coder Academy and currently developing my skills to become a junior developer. In the future, I would like to gain knowledge and skills in data analysis and artificial intelligence.

### More Information

Besides coding, I am passionate about travelling, reading and the great outdoors! I am proud of travelling solo to many countries and places around the world. I am a product of my determination, hard work and desire to explore and learn new things!
